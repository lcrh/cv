    summary:
      - I am a **research engineer** and **technical leader** with 10+ years of
        professional experience in software engineering, ML engineering and 
        research. I am seeking a challenging IC role on the cutting-edge of
        AI research or product development as part of a capable team.  My
        academic background is in automated reasoning and static analysis, and I
        am particularly interested in the intersection of **machine learning**,
        **automated reasoning** and **program search**.
      - "**Key skills**: ML, RL, generative AI  agents, software engineering,
        greenfield AI product development,
        automated reasoning, SAT/SMT, formal verification, theorem proving."

        highlights:
          - Led research team of 3 on **interactive training of video game AI** for game testing.
          - Developed novel techniques in imitation learning and RL to build a product that allows
            ML-naive game developers to train useful agents on interactive time-scales.
          - Initiated a company pivot from ML to Voyager-style **LLM-based code generation**
            for video game AI ([GDC trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sRZOqF9MgM)),
            owning the project from prototype through deployment.
          - Developed an open-source framework for generative software,
            **enact** ([github]((https://github.com/agentic-ai/enact)) to serve as
            the basis of our agents stack.
          - Key contributor to all aspects of development, including backend infrastructure,
            research, UX and product.
