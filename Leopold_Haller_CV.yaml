    summary:
      - I am a **research engineer** and **technical leader** with 10+ years of
        professional experience in software engineering, ML engineering and 
        research. With a foundation in automated reasoning and formal verification, 
        and recent work in generative AI and program synthesis, I am
        particularly interested in exploring the intersection of these fields.
        Seeking a challenging IC role on the cutting-edge of AI research or
        product development as part of a capable team. 
      - "**Key skills**: ML, RL, generative AI agents, software engineering,
         greenfield AI product development, automated reasoning, SAT/SMT, formal
         verification, theorem proving."
